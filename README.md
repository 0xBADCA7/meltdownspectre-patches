# meltdownspectre-patches
Summary of the patch status for Meltdown / Spectre

What?
=====

Meltdown and Spectre are hardware design vulnerabilities in all modern CPUs based on
speculative execution. Background infos:

 * https://spectreattack.com/ or https://meltdownattack.com/ (both pages serve identical content)
 * https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.dk/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html

The bug is in the hardware, but mitigations in operating systems are possible and are getting
shipped now. I'm collecting notes on the patch status in various software products. This will
change rapidly and may contain errors. If you have better info please send pull requests.

Linux upstream kernel
=====================

[Kernel Page Table Isolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_page-table_isolation#cite_note-:2-4)
is a mitigation in the Linux Kernel, originally named KAISER.

 * [Version 4.14](https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.14.11) contains KPTI.
 * [Version 4.15-rc6](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?h=v4.15-rc6) contains KPTI.
 * The patches have not been backported to the longterm kernels like 4.9 (state: 4.9.74).

minipli patches
===============

minipli is an unofficial fork of the former grsecurity patches (original grsecurity is no longer publicly
available). minipli is based on the longterm kernel 4.9 which does not contain KPTI yet.

 * [bug report with discussion about backporting KPTI](https://github.com/minipli/linux-unofficial_grsec/issues/25)

CPU microcode
=============

Latest [Intel microcode](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/27337) update is 20171117.
It is unclear whether microcode updates are needed and which version contains
them. The microcode update does not contain any changelog.  
If it will become necessary to update Intel (or AMD) microcode under Windows, before the release of official OS-level patches, [this VMware Labs fling](https://labs.vmware.com/flings/vmware-cpu-microcode-update-driver) - though formally experimental - can serve the purpose, at least temporarily.

**Update - Thu 4 Jan 2018, 15:30 UTC**

It seems that the new Intel’s microcode archive (2017-12-15) provided with the latest Red Hat’s microcode_ctl update includes three new files: 06-3f-02, 06-4f-01, 06-55-04.

Based on what we know:
1. it adds one new CPUID and two MSR for the variant of Spectre that uses indirect branches
2. it forces LFENCE to terminate the execution of all previous instructions, thus having the desired effect for the variant of Spectre that uses conditional branches (out-of-bounds-bypass)

Those IDs belong to the following processor microarchitectures: Haswell, Broadwell, Skylake ([official reference](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-architecture-and-processor-identification-with-cpuid-model-and-family-numbers))

**Update - Thu 4 Jan 2018, 16:30 UTC**

Regarding AMD's microcode update: it seems to be only for EPYC (maybe Ryzen, not sure!) and it only adds one of the two MSRs (IA32_PRED_CMD). It uses a different bit than Intel's in the CPUID. It is also for Spectre with indirect branches. Previous microprocessors resolved it with a chicken bit. Please note that the same solution implemented at kernel level works for both Intel and AMD.

Antiviruses
===========

Some Antiviruses do things that break when installing the Windows patches,
therefore Microsoft doesn't automatically install the patches on those systems.

Mitigation: Remove Antivirus.
